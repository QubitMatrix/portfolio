## Overview
A secure password vault written in python to generate and store passwords in a database using encryptions.

## Features
- No password is visible as plaintext, all passwords entered on the terminal are hidden
- Retrieved password is not displayed anywhere, it is directly copied to the clipboard
- Clipboard cleared after every use to avoid password leakage
- Follows Defence-in-Depth and uses three levels of authentication before retrieving a password and two levels to enter or modify passwords
- Passwords are stored into the database after encrypting it twice, first with a random session key and second with a master key inputted by user, 128 bit AES encryption used
- Reminder at login to change passwords that are older than 60 days
- Inbuilt password generator
